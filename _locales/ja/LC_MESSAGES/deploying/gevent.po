"Prefer using :doc:`gunicorn` or :doc:`uwsgi` with gevent workers rather "
"than using `gevent`_ directly. Gunicorn and uWSGI provide much more "
"configurable and production-tested servers."

"`gevent`_ allows writing asynchronous, coroutine-based code that looks "
"like standard synchronous Python. It uses `greenlet`_ to enable task "
"switching without writing ``async/await`` or using ``asyncio``."

":doc:`eventlet` is another library that does the same thing. Certain "

"gevent provides a WSGI server that can handle many connections at once "
"instead of one per worker process. You must actually use gevent in your "
"own code to see any benefit to using the server."

"gevent should not be run as root because it would cause your application "
"code to run as root, which is not secure. However, this means it will not"
" be possible to bind to port 80 or 443. Instead, a reverse proxy such as "
":doc:`nginx` or :doc:`apache-httpd` should be used in front of gevent."

"You can bind to all external IPs on a non-privileged port by using "
"``0.0.0.0`` in the server arguments shown in the previous section. Don't "

"to bypass the proxy."
