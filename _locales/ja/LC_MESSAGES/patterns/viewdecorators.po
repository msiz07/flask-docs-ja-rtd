"Python has a really interesting feature called function decorators.  This"
" allows some really neat things for web applications.  Because each view "
"in Flask is a function, decorators can be used to inject additional "
"functionality to one or more functions.  The :meth:`~flask.Flask.route` "
"decorator is the one you probably used already.  But there are use cases "
"for implementing your own decorator.  For instance, imagine you have a "
"view that should only be used by people that are logged in.  If a user "
"goes to the site and is not logged in, they should be redirected to the "
"login page.  This is a good example of a use case where a decorator is an"
" excellent solution."

"So let's implement such a decorator.  A decorator is a function that "
"wraps and replaces another function.  Since the original function is "
"replaced, you need to remember to copy the original function's "
"information to the new function.  Use :func:`functools.wraps` to handle "
"this for you."
