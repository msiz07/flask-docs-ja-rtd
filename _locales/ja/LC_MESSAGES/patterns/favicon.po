"A common question is how to add a favicon to a Flask application. First, "
"of course, you need an icon. It should be 16 Ã— 16 pixels and in the ICO "
"file format. This is not a requirement but a de-facto standard supported "
"by all relevant browsers. Put the icon in your static directory as "
":file:`favicon.ico`."

"Now, to get browsers to find your icon, the correct way is to add a link "
"tag in your HTML. So, for example:"

"That's all you need for most browsers, however some really old ones do "
"not support this standard. The old de-facto standard is to serve this "
"file, with this name, at the website root. If your application is not "
"mounted at the root path of the domain you either need to configure the "
"web server to serve the icon at the root or if you can't do that you're "
"out of luck. If however your application is the root you can simply route"
" a redirect::"
