"Various pieces of code can consume the request data and preprocess it. "
"For instance JSON data ends up on the request object already read and "
"processed, form data ends up there as well but goes through a different "
"code path.  This seems inconvenient when you want to calculate the "
"checksum of the incoming request data.  This is necessary sometimes for "
"some APIs."

"To use this, all you need to do is to hook the calculating stream in "
"before the request starts consuming data.  (Eg: be careful accessing "
"``request.form`` or anything of that nature.  ``before_request_handlers``"
" for instance should be careful not to access it)."
