"Flask is usually used with the decorators.  Decorators are simple and you"
" have the URL right next to the function that is called for that specific"
" URL.  However there is a downside to this approach: it means all your "
"code that uses decorators has to be imported upfront or Flask will never "
"actually find your function."
