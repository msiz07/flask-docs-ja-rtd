"What are signals?  Signals help you decouple applications by sending "
"notifications when actions occur elsewhere in the core framework or "
"another Flask extensions.  In short, signals allow certain senders to "
"notify subscribers that something happened."

"Flask comes with a couple of signals and other extensions might provide "
"more.  Also keep in mind that signals are intended to notify subscribers "
"and should not encourage subscribers to modify data.  You will notice "
"that there are signals that appear to do the same thing like some of the "
"builtin decorators do (eg: :data:`~flask.request_started` is very similar"
" to :meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request`).  However, there are differences"
" in how they work.  The core :meth:`~flask.Flask.before_request` handler,"
" for example, is executed in a specific order and is able to abort the "
"request early by returning a response.  In contrast all signal handlers "
"are executed in undefined order and do not modify any data."

"The big advantage of signals over handlers is that you can safely "
"subscribe to them for just a split second.  These temporary subscriptions"
" are helpful for unit testing for example.  Say you want to know what "
"templates were rendered as part of a request: signals allow you to do "
"exactly that."

"To subscribe to a signal, you can use the "
":meth:`~blinker.base.Signal.connect` method of a signal.  The first "
"argument is the function that should be called when the signal is "

" from a signal, you can use the :meth:`~blinker.base.Signal.disconnect` "
"method."
