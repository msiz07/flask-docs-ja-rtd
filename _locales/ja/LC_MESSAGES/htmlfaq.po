"The Flask documentation and example applications are using HTML5.  You "
"may notice that in many situations, when end tags are optional they are "
"not used, so that the HTML is cleaner and faster to load.  Because there "
"is much confusion about HTML and XHTML among developers, this document "
"tries to answer some of the major questions."

"For a while, it appeared that HTML was about to be replaced by XHTML. "
"However, barely any websites on the Internet are actual XHTML (which is "
"HTML processed using XML rules).  There are a couple of major reasons why"
" this is the case.  One of them is Internet Explorer's lack of proper "
"XHTML support. The XHTML spec states that XHTML must be served with the "
"MIME type :mimetype:`application/xhtml+xml`, but Internet Explorer "
"refuses to read files with that MIME type. While it is relatively easy to"
" configure Web servers to serve XHTML properly, few people do.  This is "
"likely because properly using XHTML can be quite painful."

"One of the most important causes of pain is XML's draconian (strict and "
"ruthless) error handling.  When an XML parsing error is encountered, the "
"browser is supposed to show the user an ugly error message, instead of "
"attempting to recover from the error and display what it can.  Most of "
"the (X)HTML generation on the web is based on non-XML template engines "
"(such as Jinja, the one used in Flask) which do not protect you from "
"accidentally creating invalid XHTML.  There are XML based template "
"engines, such as Kid and the popular Genshi, but they often come with a "
"larger runtime overhead and are not as straightforward to use because "
"they have to obey XML rules."

"The majority of users, however, assumed they were properly using XHTML. "
"They wrote an XHTML doctype at the top of the document and self-closed "
"all the necessary tags (``<br>`` becomes ``<br/>`` or ``<br></br>`` in "
"XHTML). However, even if the document properly validates as XHTML, what "
"really determines XHTML/HTML processing in browsers is the MIME type, "
"which as said before is often not set properly. So the valid XHTML was "
"being treated as invalid HTML."
