"One of the design decisions in Flask was that simple tasks should be "
"simple; they should not take a lot of code and yet they should not limit "
"you. Because of that, Flask has a few design choices that some people "
"might find surprising or unorthodox. For example, Flask uses thread-local"
" objects internally so that you donâ€™t have to pass objects around from "
"function to function within a request in order to stay threadsafe. This "
"approach is convenient, but requires a valid request context for "
"dependency injection or when attempting to reuse code which uses a value "
"pegged to the request.  The Flask project is honest about thread-locals, "
"does not hide them, and calls out in the code and documentation where "
"they are used."

"If you write a web application, you are probably allowing users to "
"register and leave their data on your server.  The users are entrusting "
"you with data. And even if you are the only user that might leave data in"
" your application, you still want that data to be stored securely."

"Unfortunately, there are many ways the security of a web application can "
"be compromised.  Flask protects you against one of the most common "
"security problems of modern web applications: cross-site scripting (XSS)."
"  Unless you deliberately mark insecure HTML as secure, Flask and the "
"underlying Jinja2 template engine have you covered.  But there are many "
"more ways to cause security problems."

"The documentation will warn you about aspects of web development that "
"require attention to security.  Some of these security concerns are far "
"more complex than one might think, and we all sometimes underestimate the"
" likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited - until a clever "
"attacker figures out a way to exploit our applications.  And don't think "
"that your application is not important enough to attract an attacker.  "
"Depending on the kind of attack, chances are that automated bots are "
"probing for ways to fill your database with spam, links to malicious "
"software, and the like."
