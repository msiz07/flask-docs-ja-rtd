"The :class:`Flask` application object has attributes, such as "
":attr:`~Flask.config`, that are useful to access within views and "
":doc:`CLI commands </cli>`. However, importing the ``app`` instance "
"within the modules in your project is prone to circular import issues. "
"When using the :doc:`app factory pattern </patterns/appfactories>` or "
"writing reusable :doc:`blueprints </blueprints>` or :doc:`extensions "
"</extensions>` there won't be an ``app`` instance to import at all."
