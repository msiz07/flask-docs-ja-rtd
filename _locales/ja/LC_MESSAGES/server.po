"The :command:`flask` command line script (:ref:`cli`) is strongly "

"Prior to Flask 1.0 the :envvar:`FLASK_ENV` environment variable was not "
"supported and you needed to enable debug mode by exporting "

"This works well for the common case but it does not work well for "
"development which is why from Flask 0.11 onwards the :command:`flask` "
"method is recommended.  The reason for this is that due to how the reload"
" mechanism works there are some bizarre side-effects (like executing "
"certain code twice, sometimes crashing without message or dying when a "
"syntax or import error happens)."
