msgid "External debuggers, such as those provided by IDEs, can offer a more powerful debugging experience than the built-in debugger. They can also be used to step through code during a request before an error is raised, or if no error is raised. Some even have a remote mode so you can debug code running on another machine."

If the built-in debugger is not disabled, it will catch unhandled exceptions before the external debugger can. If the reloader is not disabled, it could cause an unexpected reload if code changes during debugging."
