msgid "The good old \"chap, you made a mistake typing that URL\" message.  So common that even novices to the internet know that 404 means: damn, the thing I was looking for is not there.  It's a very good idea to make sure there is actually something useful on a 404 page, at least a link back to the index."

msgid "Did you know that there the \"404 Not Found\" has a brother named \"410 Gone\"?  Few people actually implement that, but the idea is that resources that previously existed and got deleted answer with 410 instead of 404.  If you are not deleting documents permanently from the database but just mark them as deleted, do the user a favour and use the 410 code instead and display a message that what they were looking for was deleted for all eternity."

msgid "An error handler is a function that returns a response when a type of error is raised, similar to how a view is a function that returns a response when a request URL is matched. It is passed the instance of the error being handled, which is most likely a :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.HTTPException`. An error handler for \"500 Internal Server Error\" will be passed uncaught exceptions in addition to explicit 500 errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/patterns/errorpages.rst:57
msgid "An error handler is registered with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.errorhandler` decorator or the :meth:`~flask.Flask.register_error_handler` method. A handler can be registered for a status code, like 404, or for an exception class."
