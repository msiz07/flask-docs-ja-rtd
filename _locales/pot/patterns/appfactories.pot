msgid "If you are already using packages and blueprints for your application (:doc:`/blueprints`) there are a couple of really nice ways to further improve the experience.  A common pattern is creating the application object when the blueprint is imported.  But if you move the creation of this object into a function, you can then create multiple instances of this app later."

Of course you could have multiple instances with different configs set up in your webserver, but if you use factories, you can have multiple instances of the same application running in the same application process which can be handy."
