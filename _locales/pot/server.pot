msgid "This works well for the common case but it does not work well for development which is why from Flask 0.11 onwards the :command:`flask` method is recommended.  The reason for this is that due to how the reload mechanism works there are some bizarre side-effects (like executing certain code twice, sometimes crashing without message or dying when a syntax or import error happens)."
