To use your WSGI application with uWSGI protocol you will need a uWSGI server first. uWSGI is both a protocol and an application server; the application server can serve uWSGI, FastCGI, and HTTP protocols."

msgid "The ``--manage-script-name`` will move the handling of ``SCRIPT_NAME`` to uwsgi, since it is smarter about that. It is used together with the ``--mount`` directive which will make requests to ``/yourapplication`` be directed to ``myapp:app``. If your application is accessible at root level, you can use a single ``/`` instead of ``/yourapplication``. ``myapp`` refers to the name of the file of your flask application (without extension) or the module which provides ``app``. ``app`` is the callable inside of your application (usually the line reads ``app = Flask(__name__)``."
