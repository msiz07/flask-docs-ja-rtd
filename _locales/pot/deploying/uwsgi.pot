msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:22
msgid "uWSGI has multiple ways to install it. The most straightforward is to install the ``pyuwsgi`` package, which provides precompiled wheels for common platforms. However, it does not provide SSL support, which can be provided with a reverse proxy instead."

msgid "If you have a compiler available, you can install the ``uwsgi`` package instead. Or install the ``pyuwsgi`` package from sdist instead of wheel. Either method will include SSL support."

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:52

msgid "Binding Externally"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:92
msgid "uWSGI should not be run as root with the configuration shown in this doc because it would cause your application code to run as root, which is not secure. However, this means it will not be possible to bind to port 80 or 443. Instead, a reverse proxy such as :doc:`nginx` or :doc:`apache-httpd` should be used in front of uWSGI. It is possible to run uWSGI as root securely, but that is beyond the scope of this doc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:99
msgid "uWSGI has optimized integration with `Nginx uWSGI`_ and `Apache mod_proxy_uwsgi`_, and possibly other servers, instead of using a standard HTTP proxy. That configuration is beyond the scope of this doc, see the links for more information."

msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:122
msgid "The default sync worker is appropriate for many use cases. If you need asynchronous support, uWSGI provides a `gevent`_ worker. This is not the same as Python's ``async/await``, or the ASGI server spec. You must actually use gevent in your own code to see any benefit to using the worker."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/deploying/uwsgi.rst:128
msgid "When using gevent, greenlet>=1.0 is required, otherwise context locals such as ``request`` will not work as expected. When using PyPy, PyPy>=7.3.7 is required."
