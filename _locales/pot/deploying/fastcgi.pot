msgid "FastCGI is a deployment option on servers like `nginx`_, `lighttpd`_, and `cherokee`_; see :doc:`uwsgi` and :doc:`wsgi-standalone` for other options. To use your WSGI application with any of them you will need a FastCGI server first. The most popular one is `flup`_ which we will use for this guide. Make sure to have it installed to follow along."

There are few ways to configure your application so that yourapplication.fcgi does not appear in the URL. A preferable way is to use the ScriptAlias and SetHandler configuration directives to route requests to the FastCGI server. The following example uses FastCgiServer to start 5 instances of the application which will handle all incoming requests::"
