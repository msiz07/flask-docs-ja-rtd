msgid "Flask uses standard Python :mod:`logging`. Messages about your Flask application are logged with :meth:`app.logger <flask.Flask.logger>`, which takes the same name as :attr:`app.name <flask.Flask.name>`. This logger can also be used to log your own messages."

msgid "When you want to configure logging for your project, you should do it as soon as possible when the program starts. If :meth:`app.logger <flask.Flask.logger>` is accessed before logging is configured, it will add a default handler. If possible, configure logging before creating the application object."

msgid "If you do not configure logging yourself, Flask will add a :class:`~logging.StreamHandler` to :meth:`app.logger <flask.Flask.logger>` automatically. During requests, it will write to the stream specified by the WSGI server in ``environ['wsgi.errors']`` (which is usually :data:`sys.stderr`). Outside a request, it will log to :data:`sys.stderr`."
