msgid "This part of the tutorial assumes you have a server that you want to deploy your application to. It gives an overview of how to create the distribution file and install it, but won't go into specifics about what server or software to use. You can set up a new environment on your development computer to try out the instructions below, but probably shouldn't use it for hosting a real public application. See :doc:`/deploying/index` for a list of many different ways to host your application."
