msgid "While it's designed to give a good starting point, the tutorial doesn't cover all of Flask's features. Check out the :ref:`quickstart` for an overview of what Flask can do, then dive into the docs to find out more. The tutorial only uses what's provided by Flask and Python. In another project, you might decide to use :ref:`extensions` or other libraries to make some tasks simpler."

msgid "Flask is flexible. It doesn't require you to use any particular project or code layout. However, when first starting, it's helpful to use a more structured approach. This means that the tutorial will require a bit of boilerplate up front, but it's done to avoid many common pitfalls that new developers encounter, and it creates a project that's easy to expand on. Once you become more comfortable with Flask, you can step out of this structure and take full advantage of Flask's flexibility."
