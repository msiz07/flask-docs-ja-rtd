msgid "The Application Context"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:6
msgid "The application context keeps track of the application-level data during a request, CLI command, or other activity. Rather than passing the application around to each function, the :data:`current_app` and :data:`g` proxies are accessed instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:11
msgid "This is similar to the :doc:`/reqcontext`, which keeps track of request-level data during a request. A corresponding application context is pushed when a request context is pushed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Purpose of the Context"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:18
msgid "The :class:`Flask` application object has attributes, such as :attr:`~Flask.config`, that are useful to access within views and :doc:`CLI commands </cli>`. However, importing the ``app`` instance within the modules in your project is prone to circular import issues. When using the :doc:`app factory pattern </patterns/appfactories>` or writing reusable :doc:`blueprints </blueprints>` or :doc:`extensions </extensions>` there won't be an ``app`` instance to import at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:27
msgid "Flask solves this issue with the *application context*. Rather than referring to an ``app`` directly, you use the :data:`current_app` proxy, which points to the application handling the current activity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:31
msgid "Flask automatically *pushes* an application context when handling a request. View functions, error handlers, and other functions that run during a request will have access to :data:`current_app`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:35
msgid "Flask will also automatically push an app context when running CLI commands registered with :attr:`Flask.cli` using ``@app.cli.command()``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lifetime of the Context"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:42
msgid "The application context is created and destroyed as necessary. When a Flask application begins handling a request, it pushes an application context and a :doc:`request context </reqcontext>`. When the request ends it pops the request context then the application context. Typically, an application context will have the same lifetime as a request."

msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:56
msgid "If you try to access :data:`current_app`, or anything that uses it, outside an application context, you'll get this error message:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:67
msgid "If you see that error while configuring your application, such as when initializing an extension, you can push a context manually since you have direct access to the ``app``. Use :meth:`~Flask.app_context` in a ``with`` block, and everything that runs in the block will have access to :data:`current_app`. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:81
msgid "If you see that error somewhere else in your code not related to configuring the application, it most likely indicates that you should move that code into a view function or CLI command."

msgid "Storing Data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:89
msgid "The application context is a good place to store common data during a request or CLI command. Flask provides the :data:`g object <g>` for this purpose. It is a simple namespace object that has the same lifetime as an application context."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:95
msgid "The ``g`` name stands for \"global\", but that is referring to the data being global *within a context*. The data on ``g`` is lost after the context ends, and it is not an appropriate place to store data between requests. Use the :data:`session` or a database to store data across requests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:101
msgid "A common use for :data:`g` is to manage resources during a request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:103
msgid "``get_X()`` creates resource ``X`` if it does not exist, caching it as ``g.X``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:105
msgid "``teardown_X()`` closes or otherwise deallocates the resource if it exists. It is registered as a :meth:`~Flask.teardown_appcontext` handler."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:109
msgid "For example, you can manage a database connection using this pattern::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:126
msgid "During a request, every call to ``get_db()`` will return the same connection, and it will be closed automatically at the end of the request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:130
msgid "You can use :class:`~werkzeug.local.LocalProxy` to make a new context local from ``get_db()``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:136
msgid "Accessing ``db`` will call ``get_db`` internally, in the same way that :data:`current_app` works."
msgstr ""

#: ../../flask/docs/appcontext.rst:141
msgid "If you're writing an extension, :data:`g` should be reserved for user code. You may store internal data on the context itself, but be sure to use a sufficiently unique name. The current context is accessed with :data:`_app_ctx_stack.top <_app_ctx_stack>`. For more information see :doc:`/extensiondev`."
