This is why we recommend using `Sentry <https://sentry.io/>`_ for dealing with application errors.  It's available as an Open Source project `on GitHub <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry>`_ and is also available as a `hosted version <https://sentry.io/signup/>`_ which you can try for free. Sentry aggregates duplicate errors, captures the full stack trace and local variables for debugging, and sends you mails based on new errors or frequency thresholds."

Be sure to craft your handler carefully so you don't lose information about the HTTP error."

However, this is similar to doing ``except Exception:`` in Python, it will capture *all* otherwise unhandled errors, including all HTTP status codes. In most cases it will be safer to register handlers for more specific exceptions. Since ``HTTPException`` instances are valid WSGI responses, you could also pass them through directly."
